# Nutrition Data Scraper

This project scrapes **nutritional data** (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc.) for Turkish foods, drinks, and brands from [diyetkolik.com](https://www.diyetkolik.com), and saves the results into an Excel file. It uses **Selenium** for web automation and reads search terms from a `.txt` file to allow flexibility and easy customization.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The structure of diyetkolik.com may change over time. If the CSS selectors or page layout is updated, you may need to modify the scraping logic accordingly in `config.py`.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically scrapes nutrition data for Turkish food, beverages, and brand-name items.
- Dynamically reads search terms from `data/input/search_terms.txt`. (This txt file includes the names of foods, beverages and brands. To give some examples: "pirinç pilavı, cacık, kahve, ülker, eti...")
- Saves results in a clean Excel file: `data/output/calorie_dataset.xlsx`.
- Modular codebase: scraping, data processing, and utility functions are separated.
- Robust error handling and logging for stable operation.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- Cookie pop-ups: If the website displays a cookie banner, handle_cookie_popup() in scraper.py handles it. Update the cookie_accept selector in config.py if it changes.

- Timeout errors: If the page doesn't load properly, increase the TIMEOUT value in config.py (e.g., to 20 seconds).

- Layout changes: If the page structure changes, update the SELECTORS dictionary in config.py.

- Always check the scraper.log file for detailed error messages.
